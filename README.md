In this project, 🚀 I delved into the realm of credit card fraud detection using Scikit-Learn and SnapML on Jupyter Notebook. The journey began with crucial imports, including 📊 numpy, pandas, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. I utilized the 🧠 sklearn library for essential functions, such as train_test_split for dataset division, StandardScaler for feature scaling, and DecisionTreeClassifier for building the fraud detection model. To enhance model performance, I employed compute_sample_weight for class weight computation and measured the model's efficacy using roc_auc_score. Time efficiency was also a consideration, ⏱️ and I incorporated the time module to evaluate the execution time of various operations.

Moreover, I took a proactive approach by addressing potential warnings using the warnings module and filtering them out to maintain code clarity. To ensure access to the necessary dataset, I leveraged opendatasets for seamless retrieval. Installing opendatasets and snapml was a prerequisite, and I executed the installations using the %pip install command. 🛠️ This project not only honed my technical skills but also instilled a sense of caution and efficiency in handling real-world challenges.
